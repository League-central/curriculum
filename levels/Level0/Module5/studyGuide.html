<h1>Level 0 Study Guide</h1>

<h3>
Variables
</h3>

    ‘Declare and initialize a variable’ means make a variable and give it a value.
  
<p class="code">
int age = 12; <br>
String name = “Sarah”;
</p>
Remember, String is capitalized and the value always has quotes around it.<br>

Every time you want to hold a new piece of information you need to declare the variable and initialize it, by setting it equal to something.<br>

If you want to generate a random number you do it like this.
<p class="code">
int x = new Random().nextInt(10);
</p>
The number in parenthesis limits the value of the random number you will get. In this case, x will be a number between 0 and 9.<br>

<h3>
if Statements
</h3>
<p class="code">
if (condition){<br>
<br>
}<br>
else if (next condition){<br>
<br>
}<br>
else{<br>
  <br>
}<br>
</p>
The question looks like this for a String
<p class="code">(name .equals (“Sarah”))</p>
You use .equals to compare a String. The String value is in parenthesis and in quotes.
<br>
The question looks like this for an int
<p class="code">(age == 12)</p>
Remember you use == for a comparison.<br>

It is a good idea to use an else with an if statement to catch any options you didn’t think of.<br>

    
<h3>
for loop
</h3>
    
    
<p class="code">
for ( int i = 0; i&lt;10; i++){

}
</p>
<font color="green">
 int i = 0; </font><br>  This is the starting point of the loop. You must declare the int.<br>
<font color="green"> i&lt;10; </font> <br>  This is the finishing point for the loop. The loop will continue as long as i is less than 10.
 i++ This is how much the loop counter changes by each time. In this case it increments (goes up) by 1.
<p class="code">
for ( int i = 10; i>0; i-=2){<br>
<br>
}<br>
</p>
This loop counts down in 2s starting at 10.
10, 8 , 6, 4, 2.  It doesn’t go to 0 because it must be greater than 0.
Notice that you have to change from less than (&lt;) to greater than (&gt;) when you count down.<br>
    
    
<h3>
JOptionPane
  </h3>
    
    
If you want a pop up to give the user a message use
 <p class="code">
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, “Hello ”+ name);
</p>
Don’t forget the <b>null</b>, or that any text needs to be in quotes.<br>

If you want to get an answer from the user, use:
<p class="code">
	String ageString = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(“How old are you?”);
        </p>
Remember you must catch the user’s answer in a String, otherwise you can’t use it.<br><br>

Because the answer is always a String, you sometimes want to convert it to a number so you can do a calculation. This is how you do it.
     <p class="code">
	int age = Integer.parseInt(ageString);
    </p>
If you want to write something to the console, instead of using a pop-up
 <p class="code">
	System.out.println(age);
</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
    You must have a <b>main method</b> in order to start your class running.
 <p class="code">
public static void main(String[] args){<br>
<br>
}<br>
</p>

Other methods looks like this
 <p class="code">
	void drawSquare(){<br>
&nbsp;for (int i= 0; i<4; i++){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortoise.move(100);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tortoise.turn(90);<br>
&nbsp;}<br>
}<br>
</p>
    <font color="green">void</font><br> This tells you what the method will return - in this case nothing.<br><br>
<font color="green">drawSquare</font><br>  This is the name of the method, that you use to call it.<br><br>
    <font color="green">(  )</font><br> This tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it doesn’t need any.<br><br>
You call the method like this:
  <p class="code">
	drawSquare();
 </p>
Look at this method:
  <p class="code">
int sevenTimes(int number){<br>
	&nbsp;return number * 7;<br>
}<br>
 </p>
<font color="green">int</font><br> 
This method is going to a return an int so you need to create an int variable to store it. In the example below, the variable is named "answer".<br><br>
<font color="green">sevenTimes</font><br>  This is the name of the method, that you use when you call it.<br><br>
    <font color="green">(int number)</font><br> This tells you what parameters the method needs. In this case it needs you to give an int. In the example below, the int is the number 2.<br><br>
    
    <p class="code">
	int answer = sevenTimes(2);
  </p>
The value of answer will be 14.
<h3>
Modulo
</h4>
Modulo means remainder.<br>
The value of 11%5 is 1, because 5 goes into 11, 2 times (5x2=10) with a remainder of 1.
<br><br>
It is useful to use modulo to alternate between options. e.g.
 <p class="code">
for (int i = 0; i<1000;i+=10){<br>
&nbsp;	if (i%3==0){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;		fill(255,0,0);<br>
&nbsp;	}<br>
&nbsp;	else if (i%3==1){<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;		fill(0,255,0);<br>
&nbsp;	}<br>
&nbsp;else if (i%3==2){<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;	fill(0,0,255);<br>
	&nbsp;}<br>
	&nbsp;ellipse(i,i,10,10);<br>
}<br>

                          </p>
This code will draw a line of circles alternating in red, green and blue.
