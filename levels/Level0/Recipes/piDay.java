	// 1. Make a main method and check that program can run

	// 2. Make a String variable called pi to hold some of the digits of Pi. 
	// If you don't know Pi, go to  http://www.piday.org/million/ to get as many digits as you like.
	// Just make sure you have at least 10!

	// 3. Print out 4 of the digits of your string.
	// HINT: The first value is pi.charAt(0), the second is pi.charAt(1)......
	// Run your code and you should see 3.14 in the Console.

	// 4. Ask the user what the next digit of Pi is.
	// If they get it right, congratulate them 
	// If they get it wrong, tell them "NO PIE FOR YOU!" and end the program   HINT:  System.exit(0);
	
	// 5. keep asking them for each new digit until the make a mistake or you run out of digits in your String
	//  If you haven't already put your code into a for loop, do it now!!!!
