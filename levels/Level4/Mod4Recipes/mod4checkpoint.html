            public Cake (String n, double r) { 
                name = n; 
                rate = r; 
            } 
            
            public abstract double calcPrice(); 
            
            public String toString() {
                return name + “\t” + rate;
            } 
        }

        i) declare an array of 20 cake objects; 
        ii) input data for cake objects and store them into the array; 
        iii) display the total price for all types of cakes; 
        iv) display the total price and the quantity sold for ready made cakes;
