                        We're going to make a discord bot! It will listen in our discord channel for a specific
                        command to be issued, and then run some sort of logic and send a message in the
                        channel.<br><br>

                    <h2 style="font-size:large">Create three new features for the bot.</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Feature 1 + Unit Tests</h4>
                    <p>Your first feature should be very simple, just to get comfortable with how the bot
                        works. It should listen for the command, and then send a simple response</p>
                    <h4>Feature 2 + Unit Tests</h4>
                    <p>Your second feature should include some sort of interaction between the user and the bot.
                        This could mean simply taking a second word as part of the command as a "parameter", or making
                        some sort of game that spans multiple commands.</p>
                    <h4>Feature 3 + Unit Tests</h4>
                    <p>Challenge yourself! Use an API to retrieve data from another service, or make a challenging
                        game. This feature should be something that you don't already feel comfortable
                        accomplishing.</p>
                    <h3 style="font-size:large">Additional Requirements That Help Keep Our Bot Clean:</h3>
                    <br/>
                    <div style="width:100%">
                        <ol style="float:left; width:90%; padding: .5em 12em 1em 2em;">
                            <li>Each feature should have a help embed. This will provide details about your feature when
                                the user types "!help" into the chat. For implementation details, please view the
                                constructor of RandomNumber.java.
                            </li>
                            <li>Each feature must be properly unit tested.
                                You must include
                                the tests that are within the FeatureTemplateTests class. If your feature somehow ends
                                up
                                merged without appropriate unit
                                tests, or it breaks the development branch, it will be completely removed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Your feature should not print anything using System.out.println() after you are done
                                developing it. This
                                will not be seen by the user, and will only clutter up the console for other people. In
                                fact, one of the standard
                                unit tests that you should take from the example tests checks that nothing is printed
                                out in
                                this manner.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Your feature should not write to any files (i.e. do not use a FileWriter or
                                PrintWriter).
                                This
                                can introduce problems when the project is packaged as a .jar file, and also clutters up
                                the
                                project with
                                additional files. You can save values into variables that will persist for as long as
                                the
                                bot is kept running,
                                and that should provide a long enough life-span for any feature you may want to write.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Maintain and follow the current project file structure. You feature's code should be
                                created
                                in one of the
                                feature packages located inside of the
                                "src/main/java/org/jointheleague/features/student"
                                package. Any plain old
                                java objects (POJOs) that your code needs, for example when making API request, should
                                reside in an appropriately-named
                                package within the "third_feature.plain_old_java_objects" package. For example, the
                                NewApi's
                                POJOs are located here:
                                /features/examples/third_features/plain_old_java_objects/news_api
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Do not add any files outside of the "/features/student" package. Your unit tests, while
                                under
                                the "test" source set, still technically fall within this package.
                            </li>
                            <li>Once a single feature is done, create a pull request for it to merge it back into the
                                development branch. Please do not create a pull request that contains multiple features,
                                as it is much more time consuming to verify. In the message for your pull request,
                                include the command used to run your feature, as well as a little background information
                                about what it is supposed to do
                            </li>
