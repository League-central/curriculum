                        Students have never worked in a repository that was being actively developed by multiple people
                        before.
                        The following presentation describes the repository's branch structure, and provides some
                        information on
                        working in an collaborative environment.  You can walk through the presentation with the student,
                        or have them look through it themself and ask questions if they arise.  The presentation is set up
                        to provide all of the necessary information, without a requirement for narration.
