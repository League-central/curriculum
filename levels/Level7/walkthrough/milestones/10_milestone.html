                    <p>
                        After creating the test class, there are a couple additional considerations we have for this
                        controller class.
                        Our HomeController was very simple: when the endpoint received a request, it simply returned a
                        redirect as a String,
                        requiring no help from additional classes. Our "real" controller class, on the other hand,
                        requires an instance of the
                        service class in the constructor, and calls a method in the service class when an endpoint
                        receives a request. This introduces
                        multiple levels of complexity, as the service class itself requires an instance of the
                        repository, with the repository relying on
                        a request to an external service in order to fetch data for our users. However we can simplify
                        this problem using mocking.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        By mocking the instance of our service class, we are given an instance without having to
                        consider the service
                        class' own dependencies, with the added benefit that we no longer rely on the service class'
                        code to work properly
                        in order for our controller unit tests to pass. That being said, the optimal situation is that
                        our unit tests require
                        no mocking. So under what circumstances should we consider mocking the dependency of a class?
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the dependency is difficult to construct</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>e.g. its constructor takes a lot of parameters which themselves are difficult to
                                construct
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>When the dependency uses an unreliable resource
                            <ul>
                                <li>e.g. http request or reading from a file
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When we want to verify specific actions occurred when the dependency's method was invoked (white-box testing)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In our case, point number 2 is the real reason why we are mocking, although perhaps a case could be made for
                    the first point as well.  Since our repository class relies on an HTTP request to an external service, we do not want
                    to rely on that service to work in order for our unit tests to pass.

                    <p>
                        To mock the service class, we will first declare it as a member variable.  However, we will annotate this
                        field with @Mock, and instead of instantiating it in our setUp() method like a normal object, we will
                        let Mockito create the mock for us:
                        <pre>
    private LocController locController;

    @Mock
    private LocService locService;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);

        locController = new LocController(locService);
    }
                </pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Testing getResults()</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                       Testing this method will follow the same general steps as when we tested the home() method in the
                        HomeController, with one notable difference: we want to stub the method that is called in the service class.
                        When we mock an object, what happens behind the scenes is that Mockito creates a subclass of that object where
                        all of the methods simply return default values.  This may be undesirable, especially since the "actual" value
                        which we will make an assertion on will likely be a result of the class which we have mocked.  To get around this,
                         we can using stubbing to specify the exact value that we want to be returned when we invoke a method in a mocked class.
                        We will use some special syntax to specify the method we wish to stub, as well as specify the value we want returned when
                        the method is invoked.  You will notice that the stub specifically starts with the when() method, but the test in its
                    entirety should look like this:
                        <pre>
@Test
void whenGetResults_thenReturnLocResult() {
    //given
    String query = "java";
    LocResponse expectedLocResponse = new LocResponse();

    when(locService.getResults(query))
        .thenReturn(expectedLocResponse);

    //when
    LocResponse actualLocResponse = locController.getResults(query);

    //then
    assertEquals(expectedLocResponse, actualLocResponse);
    }
                </pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                        Assuming you were consistent with your method names throughout the controller, service, and repository
                        classes, the service class test will be nearly identical to controller class test.  Remember that in a
                        more complex application, there may be a lot of logic contained within the service layer, often times making
                        it the most complex layer to test.  However since our service class is merely calling a method in the repository class,
                        the only real difference from our controller test is the classes on which we are calling the methods.  Using all of the
                        topics we have discussed so far, go ahead and complete the tests for the service class.
