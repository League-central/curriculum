                    <p>
                        With our integration tests, we will issue a "fake" request to our application, and check to see
                        that
                        Spring invokes the correct method when a request is made to a certain endpoint. Notice how this
                        differs from our unit tests: in our unit tests we used an instance of an object to invoke a
                        method
                        directly, and check that it returned the expected result. Here, we are taking a step back and
                        checking that when a request is issued to a certain URL, that Spring and the code that we wrote
                        end up doing the correct thing.<br/><br/>

                        Because we are testing that the application responds correctly to a request, rather than a
                        single
                        method in isolation, we need to bring up the Spring part of the application to conduct these
                        tests.
                        It is because we need to run the application as a whole for our integration tests, that
                        integrations test take much long to run that unit tests.<br/><br/>

                        In order to launch Spring for our integration test, we need another annotation: @WebMcvTest.
                        This
                        will be added right about the class definition for our HomeControllerIntTest. This annotation
                        auto-configures the Spring MVC infrastructure and the MockMVC (that will discuss shortly) for
                        use with our tests.
                        In our integration tests, we aren't going to mention any classes specifically, as we rely on
                        Spring
                        to test the mapping between a given URL and the method that is called, but we can improve our
                        @WebMvcTest annotation
                        to make our tests a little more efficient. Instead of having our integration test bring up the
                        entire
                        Spring context for our application, we can give it a "hint" as to which slice of the application
                        is needed
                        for this tests. This will allow us to only start up the slice of the application that is under
                        tests here,
                        making it run much more quickly. We can update the class annotation to
                        "@WebMvcTest(HomeController.class)"
                        to accomplish this.

                        In preparation for the next step, add a "private MockMvc mockMvc" field to the class, with an
                        @Autowired annotation above it so that it is automatically instantiated.

                        The basis of the test method will look just as it does in the unit tests. In this case,
                        something like the following would be appropriate:
                    <pre>
@Test
public void whenHome_ThenReturnMovedPermanentlyAndRedirect() {

}</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p>
                        We will use the MockMvc we created previously to execute the integration test. In general,
                        the structure of the test will be somewhat similar to our unit tests: we will execute something,
                        and then tests that the result is what we expected. For our integration tests, however, the
                        syntax
                        for will be considerable different since we are using this MockMvc to issue a request instead of
                        calling a method directly.

                        In the case of our HomeController method, we want to test that when a request is sent to the
                        root URL, "/", that two things occur. First, that an "Move Permanently" status code is returned,
                        and second that the String that redirects our use to our swagger page is sent. We will also
                        print
                        our some additional things. This makes it easy to see what went wrong in the even that our test
                        fails. The code that executes this is pretty readable, and reproduced here:
                    <pre>
@Test
public void givenController_WhenHome_ThenReturnMovedPermanentlyAndRedirect() throws Exception {
    mockMvc.perform(get("/"))
        .andDo(print())
        .andExpect(status().isMovedPermanently())
        .andExpect(redirectedUrl("swagger-ui.html"));
}</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>

                        At this point our test is complete. You should be able to run it and see that it passes.
                        Remember
                        that at this point there are multiple ways for you to run your tests. You can run it using one
                        of the
                        play buttons in the IDE gutter, or use the the Gradle "intTest" or "check" tasks.
