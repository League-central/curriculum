                        Teachers can use the <a href="https://github.com/LEAGUE-Level7/Level7-React-Frontend-Template">Front End Template</a>
                    to demonstrate how we could use a React application to take search terms from users and display the results.  The following
                        steps will provide insight on how teachers can alter the template application to display results from
                        your application.
                        <br/><br/>
                        There are two completed projects running on AWS that demonstrate what the finished product looks like:

                    <p>
                       To make this process as easy as possible, many of the fields that you need to change have been extracted into
                        the properties.js file.  You can easily set the course name, endpoint, description, Swagger URL, list of student
                        names, and repository URL within that file.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The only changes that require going further into the code are those required to make each SearchResult component
                        properly display the contents of each result from the request.  For example, the Cheetah Search application
                        retrieves a list of books, and displays a the title, authors, and link for each book.  The Jerboa Search
                        application retrieves a list of movies, and displays the title, overview, and release date for each movie.
                        The SearchResult component needs to be altered slightly to reflect the difference in data that is received.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you are running your application locally, you can use a endpoint URL of http://localhost:5000/&ltwhatever your endpoint URL is&gt

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Passing the Data to the SearchResult</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        The SearchOutput component takes the list of data that we received from the request to the Spring application,
                        a creates a SearchResult component for each of the individuals pieces of data (each book, movie, etc).
                        On line 22 of SearchOutput.js, we need to create a prop for each of fields within our JSON object,
                        and set that equal to the field name within the JSON object.  Note that these correspond directly
                        to the list of fields that are contained with the Java object that the Spring application returns.
                    For Cheetah Search, the code on line 22 of SearchOutput.js look like this:
<pre>
 &ltSearchResult
         key={index}
         title={result.title}
         authors={result.authors}
         link={result.link}
 /&gt</pre>

                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Displaying the Data Within the SearchResult</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Now all that is left is use the props that have been passed in the SearchResult component and
                    display them properly.  The starting on line 7 of SearchResult.js is essentially HTML, so if you are familiar with that, you can
                    play with the style of the what is returned from the SearchResult to make it display exactly how you want.
                    The Cheetah Search example is actually more complicated than most, as it returns a list of authors that
                    are, in turned, mapped to an individual &ltp&gt tag:
                    <pre>
&ltarticle className={classes.Result}&gt
    &lth1&gtTitle: {props.title}&lt/h1&gt
    &lth3 className={classes.Author}&gt
    {props.authors && props.authors.map((author, index) =&gt (
        &ltp key={index}&gt{author}&lt/p&gt
    ))}
    &lt/h3&gt
    &lta href={props.link} rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt{props.link}&lt/a&gt
&lt/article&gt
</pre>
                    <br/><br/>
                    We can also see the final prop, link, is displayed as a clickable link that opens a new page.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If your object doesn't return any lists, you could simplify the above code greatly.  For example, the above code for
                    a made up animal object may look like this:
<pre>
&ltarticle className={classes.Result}&gt
    &lth1&gtSpecies: {props.species}&lt/h1&gt
    &lth3&gtNumber of legs: {props.numberOfLegs}&lth3&gt
&lt/article&gt
</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Running the Application</h3>

                    <p>
                    To run this application, you need to have <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">yarn installed</a>.
                        From that point, you may need to run "yarn install" to install the project's dependencies.  After that,
                        "yarn start" will start the frontend application and automatically open it in your browser.

                    <p>
                        If you set up the front end correctly, you should now be able to enter a search query and display
                        results relevant to that term.  After our long journey, we have seen not only how to create
                        a production-quality Spring application that provides users with data based on a specific query, but
                        now how we could display that information to a user with modern React application.
