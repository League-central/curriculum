                        IntelliJ is an IDE that has a number of features that, combined, make it a very attractive option as an IDE.
                        If you want to continue to use Eclipse, you are free to do so, but it is highly unusual for someone to choose to go back to Eclipse after making the switch.
                        You can have the students download the community edition of IntelliJ, as it is free and indistinguishable from Ultimate edition for the purpose of this class.
                        Whatever choice you make, it is recommended that you have all the students use the same setup.  While you may be tempted to take the easy route and use what the
                        students are familiar with, the learning curve for IntelliJ is very small, and will make life better in the long run.
