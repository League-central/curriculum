                        This milestone introduces Swagger, or more specifically, Spring Fox. Spring Fox is an
                        implementation
                        of the Swagger specification for Spring. In practice, the two terms can be used interchangeably.
                        With the addition of the Swagger UI dependency, our application will automatically create a nice
                        web page that can be used not only to document exactly what our application does, but also allow
                        us
                        to very easily execute requests and manually test our application.<br><br>
                        Before completion of this milestone, students will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the necessity and use of Swagger</li>
                        <li>Understand the purpose of a Controller class</li>
                        <li>Add a HomeController class to redirect to the Swagger UI</li>
                        <li>Understand and properly implement HTTP response codes in the HomeController</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While Swagger handles much of the heavy-lifting for us, we need to provide it with a little bit
                        of information about our application. First lets create a "config" folder at the base of our
                        project source
                        code (e.g. org.jointheleague.api.level7.cheetah). The name of this folder isn't especially
                        important,
                        but "config" is a good choice. Inside of this config package, create a class called
                        "ApiDocConfig.java".
                        Then, you can copy and paste the code below, or download the file here: <a
                            href="../../resources/3_milestone/ApiDocConfig.java">ApiDocConfig.java</a>.
                        Make sure to change the relevant description fields to fit your application. You can make these
                        changes before supplying the code to students:
                    <pre>

                    <p>
                        In the last section, we added the required Swagger dependencies to our build.gradle file. Lets
                        see that in action:
                    <ol style="padding-left:2.5em;">
                        <li>Run the application</li>
                        <li>In a web browser, navigate to <a href="http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html">localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html</a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </br>
                    If you receive an error saying that the page cannot be found, there are two possible solutions:
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <ol style="padding-left:2.5em;">
                        <li>The application isn't running</li>
                        <li>The code inserted into the application.yml file in the previous section is incorrectly
                            setting the port number
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </br>
                    Here we will see some of the information we included in the Swagger config file, as well as all of
                    the endpoints which our application contains. At this point, there isn't anything too exciting, but
                    shortly we will be able to use this page to test our functionality.

                    <p>
                        We will be visiting this page a lot during the course of this project in order to test our code.
                        In addition, having this Swagger UI easily available to users of our application will allow them
                        to understand what our application does. To facilitate access to this page, we will redirect
                        users
                        that visit the base URL of our application to our Swagger page. In short, when users visit
                        localhost:5000, they will be redirected to localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html. The remaining
                        sections
                        of this milestone will allow us to achieve that goal

                        First things first, let's create somewhere for all of our Controller classes to live. In
                        compliance
                        with the 3-tier architecture that was previously discussed, create a package called
                        "presentation"
                        at the same level as the config package (e.g. org.jointheleague.api.level7.cheetah).

                    <p>
                        The classes inside of our presentation package are known as "controllers". The purpose of these
                        classes is to simply map request URLs to methods that should be executed when the specified
                        request
                        is received. In this case, we want to creating a mapping for the base URL, which is simply "/".
                        While you should step through the creation of the class with students, the class in its entirety
                        will look like this:
                    <pre>
package org.jointheleague.level7.cheetah.presentation;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.CrossOrigin;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(){
            return "redirect:swagger-ui.html";
    }

}</pre>
                    <br>
                    A few notes on the annotations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            @Controller
                            <ul>
                                <li>Marks this class as a Controller</li>
                                <li>This annotation is a specialized version of the @Component annotation.</li>
                                <li>The difference between @Controller and @Component is purely cosmetic. By
                                    looking at this annotation, we immediately know that this class is a controller
                                </li>
                                <li>The purpose of the underlying @Component annotation is very important: it enables
                                    this
                                    class to be autodetected through class path scanning. What this means for us is that
                                    Spring
                                    will recognize this class as a component, and any class that implements it will
                                    <strong>automatically</strong>
                                    receive an instance of this class. Nowhere in our program will we say "new
                                    HomeController()", Spring
                                    handles that for us!
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                    Method-level annotation that specifies two things:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This HTTP verb/method for this method is "GET"</li>
                                        <li>The URL which maps to this method is "/"</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        Open the javascript console in your browser, and go to the "network" tab. Here we can see
                        exactly
                        what requests were made when we visit a web page. If you again go to
                        <a href="http://localhost:5000">localhost:5000</a>, we will see something that can be improved
                        upon.
                        At the top of the network window, you should see a row that looks like this:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="../../img/level7/swaggerRedirectStatusCode.png" alt="Swagger 302 status code"
                             style="width:100%">
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If we <a href="https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html">look up what a status code
                        of 302 means</a>,
                        you'll find that it corresponds to "Found", but that the resource resides temporarily under a
                        different URI.
                        This is inaccurate, as we will be permanently redirecting requests to the base URL, to our
                        Swagger page.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This status code is a very important piece of information. It allows us to very succinctly
                        provide the user
                        with information about the status of their request, and we should do our best to provide
                        accurate information.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Luckily Spring makes updating this information very easy. Back in the HomeController class,
                        add another annotation about the home() method:
                    <pre>
@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.MOVED_PERMANENTLY)</pre>
                    <br>
                    Now if you rerun the application and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:5000">localhost:5000</a>
                    again,
                    you should see that the status code is returned as "301", which represents that the resource is
