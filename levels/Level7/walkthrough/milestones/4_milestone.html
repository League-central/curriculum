                        Springfox is an implementation of the Swagger specification, meant specifically for Spring applications.



                        IntelliJ is an IDE that has a number of features that, combined, make it a very attractive option as an IDE.
                        If you want to continue to use Eclipse, you are free to do so, but it is highly unusual for someone to choose to go back to Eclipse after making the switch.
                        You can have the students download the community edition of IntelliJ, as it is free and indistinguishable from Ultimate edition for the purpose of this class.
                        Whatever choice you make, it is recommended that you have all the students use the same setup.  While you may be tempted to take the easy route and use what the
                        students are familiar with, the learning curve for IntelliJ is very small, and will make life better in the long run.

                        Our application is going to use another API to source relevant data for our users. Since
                        students
                        will spend mkonths on this project, it is ideal to find a topic that they are reasonably excited
                        about.
                        You can start with a brainstorming session regarding interests that the students have, and also
                        look up
                        available APIs to get an idea of what is out there. While there may be a temptation to include
                        multiple
                        APIs as sources of data, this should be undertaken with extreme caution. If the application uses
                        more than one API, that will require adding an additional repository class to communicate with
                        it, adding
                        additional data transfer objects for that API, adding additional unit tests for that repository
                        class, as
                        well as adding addition logic to the service layer that homogenizes the results from each API
                        into a single, uniform
                        domain object that we can return to the users.
                        <br><br>
                        If appropriate based on timing, you can task the students with continuing to think about what topics
                        may interest them, and then make a final decision the following class.

                        This section is strongly related the the previous one, as it may turn out that there are no good
                        APIs for the idea that the students came up with. Here are a few questions to keep in mind when
                        selecting
                        an API from which to source the data:

                        <li>Does the API follow REST principles?</li>
                        <li>Is this someone's personal project, or developed by a group of professionals?</li>
                        <li>Is this API being continuously maintained?</li>

                        <li>Does the API have a swagger page, or a web page describing the endpoints?</li>

                        Before making a final decision on what API will be used to retrieve data for this project, make sure
                        that it works as expected.  You maybe need to create an account at this point to receive and access token to
                        use with your requests, if the API requires authentication.  Use postman, your browser, or the API's swagger
                        page (if it exists) to verify that you can actually make requests and receive an appropriate response.
