                        Create a packaged named "service" at the same level as the presentation package. Service-layer
                        classes
                        contain all of the "business logic" of the application. Perhaps one of the best ways
                        to describe what the service layer contains, is by describing what it doesn't do. Remember that
                        the controller
                        classes are used to simply map request URLs to the method that we want called when they are hit,
                        and the
                        repository layer is responsible for simply retrieving a piece of data; all other code belongs in
                        the
                        service layer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The @Service is a stereotype annotation for @Component. @Service tells us humans that this
                        class is a service-layer class, but is functionally the same as @Component: it allows Spring
                        to recognize this class during component scanning, and therefore handle the instantiation of
                        this
                        class for us.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For now, we will just move the simple functionality from our controller class down into the
                        service layer.
                        Having done this, your service class will look similar to this:
                    <pre>
package org.jointheleague.api.cheetah.Cheetah_Search.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class LocService {

    public String getResults(String query){
        return "Searching for books related to " + query;
    }

}</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Connecting the Controller and Service class</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        We now need to have the method in our controller class call the method in our service class.
                        Remember
                        that the big picture is our controller class receives a request which is passed to the service
                        layer. The service
                        layer will, in turn, call a method in a repository-layer class to retrieve the relevant data,
                        which will then be
                        returned all the back up through the classes to the user.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Before we can call the method in our service layer, we need to give the controller class an
                        instance of
                        the service class to work with. Luckily Spring makes this easy for us. Because of the Spring's
                        dependency injection,
                        we will not use the "new" keyword to instantiate any of our controller, service, or repository
                        layer classes, Spring handles
                        that for us. In this case, all we need to do is add field for the service class in the
                        controller, and provide a constructor
                        that takes that service class as a parameter. Again, Spring will take it from there and actually
                        supply the controller
                        class with an instance of the service class when the controller class itself is automatically
                        instantiated by Spring.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Your controller class should now look something like this:
                    <pre>
package org.jointheleague.api.cheetah.Cheetah_Search.presentation;

import io.swagger.annotations.ApiOperation;
import io.swagger.annotations.ApiResponse;
import io.swagger.annotations.ApiResponses;
import org.jointheleague.api.cheetah.Cheetah_Search.service.LocService;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class LocController {

    private final LocService locService;

    public LocController(LocService locService) {
        this.locService = locService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/searchLocResults")
    @ApiOperation(value = "Searches for articles matching the search term",
            notes = "Response may include multiple Result values.",
            response = String.class)
    @ApiResponses(value = {
            @ApiResponse(code = 200, message = "Result(s) found"),
            @ApiResponse(code = 404, message = "Result(s) not found")
    })
    public String getResults(@RequestParam(value="q") String query){
        return locService.getResults(query);
    }

}</pre>
                </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Our Use of the Service Layer</h3>

                    <p>
                        Given the desired functionality of our application, our service class will remain rather sparse.
                    However, if we wanted to manipulate data or process it in any way, we would add code to handle that
                    within the service layer.  Another common scenario handled by the service layer is converting our data into a
                    specific "domain object" that we intend to return to our user in a certain format.  Domain objects are
                    especially useful when combining information from multiple sources into a singular format, which allows us
                    to return a uniform set of data to the user.
