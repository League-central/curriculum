                        Here we will use the WebClient class to make HTTP requests to another service. That is, we will
                        request data from another API, in order to provide the users of our application with information
                        relevant to their request.<br><br>
                        Before completion of this milestone, students will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add an instance of WebClient to their repository class</li>
                        <li>Return the data receive from the request to our users as a String</li>
                    </ul>

                        Soon we are going to need access to the base URL of the API from which we are requesting data.
                        Go ahead and create a private static final baseUrl variable in the repository class, and
                        initalize
                        it with the base URL of the API.

                    <p>
                        In our repository class, we need to add a field and a constructor to support an instance of
                        WebClient.
                        This will be accomplished the exact same way we provided the controller and service classes
                        with instances of the classes they needed. There is one slight different however: instead of
                        taking the
                        WebClient as a parameter and having Spring instantiate it for us, we are going to do it ourself
                        inside of
                        the constructor. We can also take this opportunity
                        to set the base URL of the the API to which we expect to make requests. This makes it easier to
                        execute any request that we make within this class, as we then do not need to supply it for
                        every one.
                        The syntax for instantiation can be found below:
                        <br>
                    <pre>
package org.jointheleague.api.cheetah.Cheetah_Search.repository;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Repository
public class LocRepository {

    private final WebClient webClient;

    private static final String baseUrl = "https://www.loc.gov/books";

    public LocRepository() {
        webClient = WebClient
                .builder()
                .baseUrl(baseUrl)
                .build();
    }

    public String getResults(String query){
        return "Searching for books related to " + query;
    }

}</pre>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="module">
                <div class="titleBar">
                    <h3>Requesting the Data</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        This step may look a slightly different depending on the specific API that we are requesting data from.
                        Each API will require a somewhat specific set of data for a request to be successful.  For example,
                        an API may require that you specify the format in which you wish to receive that data, as is the
                        case of the Library of Congress API.  We will also specify that we don't want any extra information with the "at" parameter,
                        and of course supply the topic that we want results relating to. Here is the completed code to
                        make our desired request to Library of Congress for a books related to a topic:
                        <pre>
public String getResults(String query) {
        return webClient.get()
                .uri(uriBuilder -> uriBuilder
                        .queryParam("fo", "json")
                        .queryParam("at", "results")
                        .queryParam("q", query)
                        .build()
                )
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(String.class)
                .block();
}</pre>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    There is a lot of syntax there.  While it is import that we understand how it works, this is a piece
                    of code that could be copy and pasted without shame.  In fact, this code was copy and pasted into these
                    instructions from a project where it was copy and pasted into.  Lets break this down line-by-line to
                    try to understand what is going on here.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>.get()</h4>
                    This represent the HTTP method that we want to use.  Here we want to make a GET request to the API to
                    simply retrieve some data.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>.uri(...)</h4>
                    We are building upon the base URL that we specified in the constructor.  Here we need to append
                    a few URL parameters to the end of the String, exactly like how we accept the topic that our users
                    are interested in with our API.  You can see in this case we are adding three URL parameters.  This chunk
                    of the URL is also known as the "query string".  If we viewed the entire request URL at this point,
                    it would look like this, given that the value "cats" was passed into our method as a parameter:
                    "https://www.loc.gov/books?fo=json&at=results&q=cats".
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>.retrieve()</h4>
                    This means that we are preparing to declare how we want to extract the response.  More specifically,
                    this retrieve() method says that we are only interested in the body of the response.  The method
                    .extract() serves a similar role, but allows direct access to the headers and status code of the
                    response.
                    </p>
                    <h4>.bodyToMono(String.class)</h4>
                    To truly understand this piece of code would require knowledge of a number of topics well beyond
                    the scope of this course, but they get to the heart of why the WebClient class represents a big step
                    forward in terms of java libraries designed to fetch data via HTTP requests. A simple explanation will
                    be provided, as well as links to further reading if you are interested in attempting a deeper understanding.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    There are a number of class that we could use in place of WebClient here, two popular choices would
                    be the HttpUrlConnection class and the RestTemplate class.  Either of these would suffice for our application,
                    but WebClient is actually the replacement for the RestTemplate class, which is now deprecated as of Spring 5.
                    The major change that is implemented by WebClient: it is asynchronous and non-blocking!  By now you are probably
                    more than willing to accept the suggestion that a deep understanding of this is not necessary.  In essence,
                    WebClient being non-blocking means that our application doesn't need to sit idly by and wait for the response.
                    It can come back when the result is ready, and in the meantime switch to another active task that uses the
                    same underlying resource.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    At the end of the day, we aren't even going to be taking advantage of the non-blocking nature of WebClient.  However
                    the reactive nature of this class is what leads us to the Mono class.  Since WebClient is designed to be asynchronous
                    and non-blocking, the request itself needs to return something that will, at a later point, contain the actual result.
                    We can't simply return the result from the request, because we will not have it yet.  The thing returned from the
                    actual request is a "publisher", an idea that comes from the reactive streams initiative linked below.  Project
                    Reactor, the reactive streams implementation created for Spring, defines two publisher classes:
                    Mono and Flux.  Mono is meant to be used when expected 0 or 1 result from our request.  Flux
                    is meant to be used when expecting 0 to n results.  Here we are only expecting one result,
                    so the bodyToMono() is used.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The parameter to this method is really the only part that is important to us here.  We are saying that
                    we want to the result to be given to us as a String. While this isn't terribly exciting at the moment,
                    we will later change this to allow our response to be given to us in the form of a custom Java class that
                    represents the information we expect from the response.  This will allow us to very easily
                    pull out the specific pieces of information we are interested in.
                    </p>
                    <h4>.block()</h4>
                    This says that we actually want to wait for the response before the execution of our application continues.
                    Essentially, this means we do not want to take advantage of the reactive stream related features of WebClient which
                    were discussed previously.  The request will be carried out with blocking, as it is when using
                    RestTemplate or other classes.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Another consequence of this method is that this long chain of methods will now return an object of
                    type String, instead of type Mono&ltString&gt.
