                    <p>
                        Up until this point, we have been manually testing our application. That is to say that whenever
                        we made a change, we have simply rerun the application and tested that it was working by
                        executing
                        some
                        requests ourselves, and checking that the response is what we expected. In reality, this may be
                        sufficient
                        for programs of limited size. For example, in the early League levels, the programs were simple
                        enough that
                        we could manually test them in a reasonable amount of time, and be left with a reasonable
                        confidence that
                        everything was in working order.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        However, as applications grow, it becomes more and more time-consuming to test every part of the
                        application
                        each time we make a change. While our application currently may have only one endpoint, you can
                        imagine that if it were to grow to having 30 endpoints, it would be unreasonably burdensome to
                        test each and every one
                        of them whenever
                        a change is made.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Luckily, this is exactly the type of thing computers are good at: repeatedly doing the same task
                        over
                        and over again, in exactly the same way. This is the true value of unit tests: not only can they
                        be run quickly
                        and repeatedly, but by doing so, we can be confident that every part of the application is still
                        working as expected.

                        When dealing with a class that doesn't require hundreds of lines of unit tests, it is best to
                        simply mirror the package structure of the source code in the test source set. That means that
                        our class located at:
                        <br/>
                        src/main/ ... /presentation/HomeController.java
                        <br/>
                        will have a corresponding test class:
                        <br/>
                        src/test/ ... /presentation/HomeControllerTest.java
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        If you are using IntelliJ, this can be easily accomplished by visiting the class you wish to
                        generate
                        a test for, and hitting command+shift+t (mac) or control+shift+t (windows). This will open a
                        dialog, within
                        which you will want to select the "setup/@Before" checkbox, as well as selecting the methods
                        for which we
                        want to generate tests. After doing so, the test class will be created in the appropriate place.

                        Before we can write the tests, there are a couple things we need to add to the test class. First
                        of all,
                        we are going to need an instance of the class that is being tested so that we are able to call
                        the methods
                        within that class. This is as simple as declaring a member variable in the test class. One thing
                        we need to be careful
                        of is ensuring that our tests don't effect each other. This brings us to the setup method which
                        is annotated
                        "@BeforeEach". As the annotation implies, this method will be run before each test is run,
                        allowing us to
                        reinitialize any objects that may have been changed by the previous test. To that end, we will
                        initialize our instance of HomeController inside of this setup method.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Renaming the home() Test Method</h3>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        Even if you selected for the IDE to generate the test method for you, you probably will want to
                        start by renaming the method. We will use the Behavior Driven Design (BDD) naming convention for
                        our methods.
                        A method that follows the BDD naming convention will be of the form:
                        <br/>
                        given&ltPrecondition&gt_when&ltMethod&gt_then&ltExpectedResult&gt
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The given section of the method name can be left off if there are no specific preconditions
                        that our test is taking into account. Once case in which using the "given" part of the name may
                        be useful is when testing that a method throws an exception when it is given an invalid input.
                        In the current case, we can simply name the method:
                        <br/>
                        whenHome_thenReturnRedirect
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Naming the method like this clearly conveys what functionality is broken in the case of the
                        test failing.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Completing the home() Test</h3>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>
                        One strategy for structuring the test method is to add comments inside of it that mirror the
                        naming convention we used:
                    <pre>
@Test
void whenHome_thenReturnRedirect() {
    //given

    //when

    //then

}</pre>
                    <br/>
                    You may find that this makes it easier to conceptualize what needs to be done to complete the
                    method.
                    Using this strategy, it's often easiest to start under the "when", where we will simply invoke the
                    method that
                    we wish to test.
                    <pre>
@Test
void whenHome_thenReturnRedirect() {
    //given

    //when
    String actual = homeController.home();

    //then

}</pre>
                    <br/>
                    This will often reveal what variables we need to create under the "//given", typically values needed
                    as
                    parameters for the method we are trying to call. Under the "//given", we can also create a variable
                    that will
                    hold the expected result from them method we are testing. In this case, we can copy and paste the
                    redirect
                    String for our HomeController class:
                    <pre>
@Test
void whenHome_thenReturnRedirect() {
    //given
    String expected = "redirect:swagger-ui.html";

    //when
    String expected = homeController.home();

    //then

}</pre>
                    <br/>
                    Finally, we need to add the assertion, or what could be considered the actual test. Under the
                    "//then", we
                    will assert that the expected result is equal to the actual result:
                    <pre>
@Test
void whenHome_thenReturnRedirect() {
    //given
    String expected = "redirect:swagger-ui.html";

    //when
    String expected = homeController.home();

    //then
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}</pre>
                    <br/>
                    Now if you run the test, you should see that the test passes.
                    </p>
